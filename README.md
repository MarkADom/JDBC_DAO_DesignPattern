# JDBC DAO Design Pattern 
This rojectP is made for study and to be added to my personal Library of Implementations.

##  Description  

#### JDBC
The JDBC API is a Java API that can access any kind of tabular data, especially data stored in a relational database.
JDBC helps you to write Java applications that manage these three programming activities:
  *Connect to a data source, like a database
  *Send queries and update statements to the database
  *Retrieve and process the results received from the database in answer to your query

#### DAO
The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural pattern that allows us to isolate the application/business 
layer from the persistence layer (usually a relational database but could be any other persistence mechanism) 
using an abstract API.
The API hides from the application all the complexity of performing CRUD operations in the underlying storage mechanism. 
This permits both layers to evolve separately without knowing anything about each other.
